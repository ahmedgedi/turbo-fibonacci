# Turbo Fibonacci

This app was created to practice using Docker and Kubernetes in a production environment. 
Its a React app with an Express backend that leverages Redis & Postgres to save user input.
Turbo Fibonacci is essentially an overkill Fibonacci Index calculator in a web app.

I've got two versions of this app. One that is a simple multi-docker container app on the master branch and one that is a kubernetes cluster deployment on the 'k8s' branch. This app also contains elements of CI/CD with TravisCI that i'll be integrating as well.
